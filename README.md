## 🐍 EMBEDDED C SNAKE GAME 🐍

Embedded Snake game built with AT89C52 microcontroller featuring motor feedback and multi-display output. The game runs on a 1.3824MHz clock using LM041L LCD for the main display, with additional 7-segment displays for score tracking. Player input comes through a matrix keyboard, and the L293D motor driver adds physical feedback to gameplay events.
<br>
The system integrates four controllers managing game logic, input processing, motor control, and scoring. Motor speed and LED indicators respond dynamically to game events, creating an interactive gaming experience.
<br>
Game uses standard directional controls (2,4,6,8) with special functions for start (*), pause (0), end (#), and skin changes (5). Score tracking includes high score memory and real-time display updates.
